# An-application-connecting-game-and-hand-clenching-spreading-motion


This application is a hand interface that could connect the hand clenching motion (recognizing less than 1 finger) 
and spreading motion (recognizing more than 3 fingers), to several kinds of game, by using both left hands and right hands. The interaction method could be 
changing the function in the flow of the game(see demo_ukiyoe_os.py or demo_ukiyoe_windows.py), and forcing key presses
(see new_final.py). 


To know more about our system, see the introduction ppt inside the app_folder folder.


To run our application, these dependencies should be needed.

    --Python >=3.5.0

    --packages in requirements.txt (if there is some packages that is left not to be used, please run pip install.)

    --A web camera with a mild-light environment.
        
Hope you could find some new issues and get involved with the further extension of this application.
